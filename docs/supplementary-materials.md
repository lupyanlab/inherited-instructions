| GEMS111  | I thought that more lines meant more valuable I also found there was a pattern where I should select a gem with more lines and more rotated clockwise than the gem I had selected previously, however, this theory was not always correct and frustrated me.                                                                                                                                                                                 | GEMS125        | The more stripes are on the gem, the more valuable it is. The more it is tilted clockwise, the more it is valuable. Your score is not affected when you choose the same gem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| GEMS112  | The more similar a gem looks to the one chosen before, the more likely it is to be more valuable. Gems with thicker stripes and gems with too thin of stripes seemed to be less valuable. Gems also seemed more valuable with not too many, but also not too little stripes.                                                                                                                                                                 | GEMS126        | the more similarity to the previously chosen one contributes to a higher value. also, the strips should not be too thick or too thin when you first choose it or when you need to choose between similar ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| GEMS113  | Even though I don’t think it necessarily worked, I tried to choose the gem that looked like it ‘did not fit’ or the one that looked the most different. However, I looked for other patterns and it seemed to be random.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | GEMS127        | I thought that what was most important was the amount of line visible in the circle and how fuzzy it was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| GEMS114  | the density of lines on the gems may be related to the value.More lines may indicate more value. Besides, the light lines may imply more value than bold lines according to my attempt. There may also exists relationship between the value of the gems and the gardient level of lines on the gems, but I do not figure it out clearly.                                                                                                    | GEMS128        | The more lines there are on the gem, the more points one will score especially towards the beginning. However it seems later towards the game, the number of lines didn’t seem to matter as much. Later towards the game, the angle at which the lines appeared on the gem seemed to matter as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GEMS115  | I believe that the gems with the most shine to them are the most valuable. you can tell based off of how much black to white there is. with more lines to it, there will be more value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | GEMS129        | Be very observant to how many lines and amount of black space there are between the white lines. Generally, the gems with less space, and more white bars ar more valuable. Also, the gems that have rotation of bars closer to facing horizontal, specifically anglig west to east will be more valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GEMS116  | I do not think there is much of a difference in the gems. I compared the darkness of the black, the thickness of the lines, the angles in which the lines were going, the shifts of movement in the lines where in such as if the left end starts with a black or white striped line. Nothing helps, so good luck trying to score the most points.                                                                                           | GEMS130        | The person before me mentioned that they tested the gems for bar width, number of bars, thickness, angle of the bars, etc. As a result, I trusted their advice and resisted the urge to test the gems for the most basic factors. What I found what that if you selected a gem for it’s unique characteristics, for example having more lines or finer detail, then the next set of gems would all display those traits. In other words, the new set of gems looks a lot more like the gem you choose than the previous set of gems. So, pay attention to every detail before choosing the next gem, and then pick the more valuable gem and note the differences. I found success in paying attention to whether it looked like it was black lines on a white background or white lines on a black background, and got points by selecting the gem that had a, more bars, and b, looked like white bars on a black background. Don’t let this narrow your mind, though, but try it and see if it works. Otherwise, go to the strategy I mentioned above |

| GEMS137  | I think gems with a higher number of lines are more valuable than gems with lower numbers. I’m not completely sure what the direction of the lines has to do with the value, but I think choosing ones close to the previously selected valuable gem will end up being the next most valuable gem.                                                                                                                                           | GEMS143        | There seems to be a number of lines which yields points more often than not. I think this was around 8. I did notice that the first gem is worth 22 points, and that one only has five lines. I couldn’t find a pattern with orientation or color. I had thought at first that the farther clockwise they go, the more worth they would have, but this proved false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GEMS138  | I found that picking gems most similar to the gem presented got me the most points. However, when I picked the gem that was identical to the gem presented, a majority of the time I got zero points. I also tried to see if the number of lines and thickness of lines make the gems more valuable. I found that more lines usually means the gem is more valuable. I did not find anything important regarding the thickness of the lines. | GEMS148        | The value of each gem seems to correlate with how it compares to the previous gem. For example, a positive value was given to a majority of gems that had lines slightly more horizontal than the last. Selecting a gem whose lines were more horizontal than the last has something to do with the value. I didnt find any correlations between number of line and thickness, however as the linqes got more and more horizontal the gems had a higher number of lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GEMS144  | the gems that have more white lines and less black space are more valuable than those that don’t. usually, the ones in the middle are worth more points than those on the outside, however, this is questionable at times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | GEMS149        | The more horizontal the lines are, the more valuable the gems are.

| GEMS145  | I think what makes more gems valuable than others is the placement of the gems and where they are located. I noticed that when clicking on the same gem in the same place multiple times, the values changed, so you have to explore other gems and move around.                                                                                                                                                                             | GEMS150        | I think that either the number of black diagonal lines has to do something with the value of the gems. The more black lines, the more valuable. When all gems had the same number of black lines, then I either guessed the left most gem, or I looked for a gem that was an outlier in angle compared to the rest of the gem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| GEMS154  | Generally the smaller the lines on the gem, the better. There needs to be about 10 white and black lines on the gem for it to be most valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | GEMS167        | The spacing between the stripes is something to pay attention to. As the spacing gets smaller, look for how straight the stripes are and that will help with improving the value of the gems. There seems to be no pattern observable to which color stripe should go first and as the thickness gets smaller it becomes very less clear which gems are more valuable. There does seem to be a pattern to look for that has to do with the angle that the stripes are in as you progress but I couldn’t figure it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| GEMS155  | the larger the number that appears on each gem, the more valuable the are. for instance, if a plus 16 appears on a gem, this indicates that the gem is of great value. whereas a minus 16 would diminish the value of the gem.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | GEMS168        | pay attention to the numeber of lines on the gems and the direction of the whole circle. at first maybe the lines of gems should increase more and more, choose the gems with more lines, it maybe more valuable. about the directon, don’t make the cirvle change the angle more than 90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| GEMS159  | When you are picking a gem , you should start by picking one of the middle gems. The next gem you pick is more valuable is the 1st gem you picked that’s the left or right side of the 1st gem picked. Pick another gem that’s in the middle of the group of gems. Then you pick a gem that is left or right of one of the middle gems.                                                                                                      | GEMS172        | try to choose the gems in the middle when you start. even though the location of gems doesn’t affect their value, it’s helpful to start from middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| GEMS162  | the way i was able to decide which gems were more valuable was by the way they look compared to the others. i first started out seeing which ones would stand out from the rest of the gems. but, once i saw that the number of lines varied i decided to look and see which had more lnes in respective to the rest. lastly, i also looked at the colors. the ones with more vivid colors i would pick over tye more blurry colored ones.   | GEMS175        | I found that the best gems were the ones with the most clear lines. Also, the gems worth the most points seemed to be tilted at about a 45 degree angle, going upwards as the gem went left to right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| GEMS183  | It took me a while to find a pattern, but what I found is that a gem becomes more valuable when it is rotated clockwise. To clairfy, when the bars more and more to the right. Howeve, I found that when it got to the center, it went the other way, so counterclockwise.                                                                                                                                                                      | GEMS199        | I noticed that the gems I selected were rotated in a certain way. When you first start out, the lines on the gems will be going up and down. From there, you’ll want to pick the gem that is turned more clockwise. Gem after gem, you’ll want to pick which one is turned the most clockwise. When that method seems to not work anymore, choose the gems that are turned more counterclockwise and go from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GEMS184  | Honestly, I did not really catch onto what makes certain gems worth more than the other gems. Some thoughts I had was maybe the strips of the previous gem selected had some correlation to the worth of the next gem. I also thought maybe the overall position if it was 1st,2nd,3rd,etc. might have had something to do with it, but none of these theories I had was backed with any evidence from the game.                                | GEMS200        | I dont really know what makes certain gems more valuable than others. I just ended up picking random gems each time trying to find correlations. Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values. So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time. I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value. In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar. |
| GEMS185  | Gems with more lines are more valuable to start. You want to go for tilted lines with a few lines thicker than the others. But at the end it’s totally random just to get in your head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | GEMS201        | Too many lines thin or thick never seemed to get a high score, other than that I could never figure out which gem was the most valuable.

| GEMS218  | While looking for gems, there appears to be a trend between the number of lines and the tilt of the lines. You should prioritize the number of lines up until a point. However, when it comes to tilt, you want to prioritize the rotation until they become parallel horizontally. Once you are at parallel, the number of lines must be fine tuned in order to find the gem of the most value.                                                | NA             | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| GEMS222  | I’m not super positive but I think what makes certain gems more valuable than others is determined by where they land on the in the sequence.

| GEMS261  | When you see the gem, i recommend you to choose a gem that has the lines of 8 to 9.
