  Congratulations! You have just arrived on Planet Teeb. You are a space explorer who has traveled here to collect precious gems, but you do not know which gems are more valuable than others.

  After arriving, you seek out a teacher who can teach you which gems are worth more than others. Pay close attention to the instructions you get from your teacher, as it will help you to find the most valuable gems in the game.

  Press the SPACEBAR to read the teacher's instructions.

  Your teacher offers to take you to a nearby quarry to find some gems. The teacher will show you a few gems to look at. You have to click on the one you think is the most valuable. Then the teacher will show you the value of the one you clicked, and the values of the ones you did not click. Your goal is to learn for yourself how to tell the most expensive gem on each trial.

  Click on the more valuable gem to continue. If you do not know which gem is more valuable, reread the instructions above. If you do not understand the instructions above, please ask for help from the researcher.

  Now you are ready to strike out on your own, to collect gems at different quarries all over Planet Teeb. Without your teacher to help you, you will only learn the value of the gem you select, and not the values of the gems you did not select. But your goal is still to select the most valuable gem on each trial.

  If you are confused about the task, or have a question you would like to ask the researcher, please do so now. When you are ready to begin collecting gems at the first quarry, press the SPACEBAR.
