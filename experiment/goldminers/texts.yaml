  The trainer offers to take you to a nearby quarry to find some gems. The trainer will give you a few of gems to look at. You have to click on the one you think is the most valuable. The trainer will show you the value of the one you clicked, and the values of the ones you did not click. Your goal is to learn to select the most valuable gem on each trial.

  Your training is complete! Now you are ready to strike out on your own, to different quarries all over the planet. Without your trainer to help you, you will only know the value of the gem you select, and not the values of the gems you do not select. But your goal is the same: to select the most valuable gem on each trial.
