1,GEMS177,"The patterned seemed to be that gems with more lines were more valuable than gems with less lines. Additionally, thicker lines appear to be a property of more valuable gems as well."
2,GEMS178,Some gems are more valuable based on there points and also they need to be similar to the gems you previously picked.
3,GEMS179,Stick with the same few gems and keep clicking them I think it is better to do that then go completely random.
4,GEMS180,The more lines they had the more valuable the gem was. Look at the pattern of the gem and see how many lines that it has.
5,GEMS181,"the more fine the lines are on the gems up to a certain point, the more valuable it is. The more horizontal the lines are as well make it more valuable."
6,GEMS182,"For certain gems, the one's that have the most lines are more valuable than the others generally. It's very hard to tell the value of gems after so many lines."
7,GEMS183,"It took me a while to find a pattern, but what I found is that a gem becomes more valuable when it is rotated clockwise. To clairfy, when the bars more and more to the right. Howeve, I found that when it got to the center, it went the other way, so counterclockwise."
8,GEMS184,"Honestly, I did not really catch onto what makes certain gems worth more than the other gems. Some thoughts I had was maybe the strips of the previous gem selected had some correlation to the worth of the next gem. I also thought maybe the overall position if it was 1st,2nd,3rd,etc. might have had something to do with it, but none of these theories I had was backed with any evidence from the game."
9,GEMS185,Gems with more lines are more valuable to start. You want to go for tilted lines with a few lines thicker than the others. But at the end it's  totally random just to get in your head.
10,GEMS186,"i don't think there are any tips. if there are more bricks appear in the screen just choose the one that is different. with more and more line in the one circle, choose the one that is similiar to other"
11,GEMS187,"The valued gems have thin stipes on them, but once the stripes are too thin the value decreases. The direction of stripes does not matter."
12,GEMS188,"Look for the gems that have the biggest boarders on the outside, where the lines are the fattest. These are the more valuable gems."
13,GEMS189,"I think that the size of the stripes, the thickness of the black and white stripes, and how zoomed in or out the gem is are determinants of what makes some gems more valuable than others. Also, at the end, I started to notice how if I collected a gem with a white line on the top, another valuable gem would be black on the top. Also, I realized that if a gem looks like the one you previously collect, it is mostly worth 0 points."
14,GEMS190,The gems that have blurry lines are less valuable. Gems with thinner lines are more valuable. Gems whose lines are horizontal are less valuable. Finding gems that look like the previous gem will either get you zero points or positive points.
15,GEMS191,"The thiner the lines, the more precious the gems. Also, I belive that the closer the gem is to having horizontal lines, it is more precious."
16,GEMS192,"When choosing the most valuble gems, choose the ones that are tilted at about 10 degrees and with lines that are almost horizontal. You should not choose lines are are tilted at negative 10 degrees or 350 degrees. The lines must also be moderate in width."
17,GEMS193,"The gems that seem to be worth more are either ones with more lines on them or ones with thicker lines. Check all of the gems in the set and if there is one that seems to have a lot more lines or a much thicker lines, then choose it. Use the value of the gems you pick to decide whether a similar gem is a good choice."
18,GEMS194,I think the gems with more value have more lines on them. So the gems with lines that are far apart and thicker will have less value then the ones with thinner and more lines on them.
19,GEMS195,instead of just trying on random gem i think it is more helpful to stick to one type of gem and try to find out the pattern of the score change
20,GEMS196,"I could not find a pattern at all. If I kept getting negative points, the gems with less lines got me points back faster."
21,GEMS197,"The more slanted the line is, the more valuable the germ is. The more lines the germ has, the more valuable the germ is."
22,GEMS198,"a combination of strategies should be used. at first it may be related to the number of lines in each gem. however, as you score more, it may be relate to the angle of the line to the horizon."
23,GEMS199,"I noticed that the gems I selected were rotated in a certain way. When you first start out, the lines on the gems will be going up and down. From there, you'll want to pick the gem that is turned more clockwise. Gem after gem, you'll want to pick which one is turned the most clockwise. When that method seems to not work anymore, choose the gems that are turned more counterclockwise and go from there."
24,GEMS200,"I dont really know what makes certain gems more valuable than others.  I just ended up picking random gems each time trying to find correlations.  Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values.  So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time.  I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value.  In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar."
25,GEMS201,"Too many lines thin or thick never seemed to get a high score, other than that I could never figure out which gem was the most valuable. The previous instructions had been to look for the thicker lines with more stripes, but that did not seem to benefit."
26,GEMS202,the only small pattern i found was picking out the gem that didn't match the others. i didn't think your previous gem mattered.
27,GEMS203,It seemed like the onrs that were more valuable alternated based on the thickness of the lines in the gems
28,GEMS204,"the last person wrote the more valuable gems are the fattest and the borders are wide but it really depends. after several time i chose the thicker black line, it doesn't work anymore."
29,GEMS205,"You will think that the gems all look the same. As you progress, the lines become more focused and thinner. Keep picking the one with the most lines. One that has less lines that the previous one will give you negative points. One exactly the same will give you zero points. Once the lines are pretty small, start to look at the angle of them. An angle that isn't the same but not totally different is a good one to pick."
30,GEMS206,"Try to pick the gem that is most similar to the last gem you picked. Also, choose the gem that that has a medium sized line and the one with the most vertical lines."
31,GEMS207,"The thinner the stripes, the more valuable the gem. Not sure if the direction of the stripes is important, I was thinking the more horizontal the more valuable."
32,GEMS208,I think the gems tilted at 10 degrees are most valuable. I also think that the gems with the biggest lines out of the 5 on the screen are the least valuable. Do not click the same gem more than 3 times in a row.
