Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values.  So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time.  I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value.  In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar."

Annie,3,42,Orientation,GEMS218,"While looking for gems, there appears to be a trend between the number of lines and the tilt of the lines. You should prioritize the number of lines up until a point. However, when it comes to tilt, you want to prioritize the rotation until they become parallel horizontally. Once you are at parallel, the number of lines must be fine tuned in order to find the gem of the most value."
