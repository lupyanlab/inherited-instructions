pierce,0.0,8,Orientation,GEMS184,"Honestly, I did not really catch onto what makes certain gems worth more than the other gems. Some thoughts I had was maybe the strips of the previous gem selected had some correlation to the worth of the next gem. I also thought maybe the overall position if it was 1st,2nd,3rd,etc. might have had something to do with it, but none of these theories I had was backed with any evidence from the game."

pierce,0.0,13,Orientation,GEMS189,"I think that the size of the stripes, the thickness of the black and white stripes, and how zoomed in or out the gem is are determinants of what makes some gems more valuable than others. Also, at the end, I started to notice how if I collected a gem with a white line on the top, another valuable gem would be black on the top. Also, I realized that if a gem looks like the one you previously collect, it is mostly worth 0 points."

From there, you'll want to pick the gem that is turned more clockwise. Gem after gem, you'll want to pick which one is turned the most clockwise. When that method seems to not work anymore, choose the gems that are turned more counterclockwise and go from there."

Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values.  So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time.  I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value.  In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar."

One that has less lines that the previous one will give you negative points. One exactly the same will give you zero points. Once the lines are pretty small, start to look at the angle of them. An angle that isn't the same but not totally different is a good one to pick."
