1,GEMS177,"The patterned seemed to be that gems with more lines were more valuable than gems with less lines. Additionally, thicker lines appear to be a property of more valuable gems as well."
2,GEMS178,Some gems are more valuable based on there points and also they need to be similar to the gems you previously picked.
3,GEMS179,Stick with the same few gems and keep clicking them I think it is better to do that then go completely random.
4,GEMS180,The more lines they had the more valuable the gem was. Look at the pattern of the gem and see how many lines that it has.
5,GEMS181,"the more fine the lines are on the gems up to a certain point, the more valuable it is. The more horizontal the lines are as well make it more valuable."
6,GEMS182,"For certain gems, the one's that have the most lines are more valuable than the others generally. It's very hard to tell the value of gems after so many lines."
7,GEMS183,"It took me a while to find a pattern, but what I found is that a gem becomes more valuable when it is rotated clockwise. To clairfy, when the bars more and more to the right. Howeve, I found that when it got to the center, it went the other way, so counterclockwise."
8,GEMS184,"Honestly, I did not really catch onto what makes certain gems worth more than the other gems. Some thoughts I had was maybe the strips of the previous gem selected had some correlation to the worth of the next gem. I also thought maybe the overall position if it was 1st,2nd,3rd,etc. might have had something to do with it, but none of these theories I had was backed with any evidence from the game."
9,GEMS185,Gems with more lines are more valuable to start. You want to go for tilted lines with a few lines thicker than the others. But at the end it's  totally random just to get in your head.
10,GEMS186,"i don't think there are any tips. if there are more bricks appear in the screen just choose the one that is different. with more and more line in the one circle, choose the one that is similiar to other"
11,GEMS187,"The valued gems have thin stipes on them, but once the stripes are too thin the value decreases. The direction of stripes does not matter."
12,GEMS188,"Look for the gems that have the biggest boarders on the outside, where the lines are the fattest. These are the more valuable gems."
13,GEMS189,"I think that the size of the stripes, the thickness of the black and white stripes, and how zoomed in or out the gem is are determinants of what makes some gems more valuable than others. Also, at the end, I started to notice how if I collected a gem with a white line on the top, another valuable gem would be black on the top. Also, I realized that if a gem looks like the one you previously collect, it is mostly worth 0 points."
14,GEMS190,The gems that have blurry lines are less valuable. Gems with thinner lines are more valuable. Gems whose lines are horizontal are less valuable. Finding gems that look like the previous gem will either get you zero points or positive points.
15,GEMS191,"The thiner the lines, the more precious the gems. Also, I belive that the closer the gem is to having horizontal lines, it is more precious."
16,GEMS192,"When choosing the most valuble gems, choose the ones that are tilted at about 10 degrees and with lines that are almost horizontal. You should not choose lines are are tilted at negative 10 degrees or 350 degrees. The lines must also be moderate in width."
17,GEMS193,"The gems that seem to be worth more are either ones with more lines on them or ones with thicker lines. Check all of the gems in the set and if there is one that seems to have a lot more lines or a much thicker lines, then choose it. Use the value of the gems you pick to decide whether a similar gem is a good choice."
18,GEMS194,I think the gems with more value have more lines on them. So the gems with lines that are far apart and thicker will have less value then the ones with thinner and more lines on them.
19,GEMS195,instead of just trying on random gem i think it is more helpful to stick to one type of gem and try to find out the pattern of the score change
20,GEMS196,"I could not find a pattern at all. If I kept getting negative points, the gems with less lines got me points back faster."
21,GEMS197,"The more slanted the line is, the more valuable the germ is. The more lines the germ has, the more valuable the germ is."
22,GEMS198,"a combination of strategies should be used. at first it may be related to the number of lines in each gem. however, as you score more, it may be relate to the angle of the line to the horizon."
23,GEMS199,"I noticed that the gems I selected were rotated in a certain way. When you first start out, the lines on the gems will be going up and down. From there, you'll want to pick the gem that is turned more clockwise. Gem after gem, you'll want to pick which one is turned the most clockwise. When that method seems to not work anymore, choose the gems that are turned more counterclockwise and go from there."
24,GEMS200,"I dont really know what makes certain gems more valuable than others.  I just ended up picking random gems each time trying to find correlations.  Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values.  So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time.  I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value.  In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar."
25,GEMS201,"Too many lines thin or thick never seemed to get a high score, other than that I could never figure out which gem was the most valuable. The previous instructions had been to look for the thicker lines with more stripes, but that did not seem to benefit."
26,GEMS202,the only small pattern i found was picking out the gem that didn't match the others. i didn't think your previous gem mattered.
27,GEMS203,It seemed like the onrs that were more valuable alternated based on the thickness of the lines in the gems
28,GEMS204,"the last person wrote the more valuable gems are the fattest and the borders are wide but it really depends. after several time i chose the thicker black line, it doesn't work anymore."
29,GEMS205,"You will think that the gems all look the same. As you progress, the lines become more focused and thinner. Keep picking the one with the most lines. One that has less lines that the previous one will give you negative points. One exactly the same will give you zero points. Once the lines are pretty small, start to look at the angle of them. An angle that isn't the same but not totally different is a good one to pick."
30,GEMS206,"Try to pick the gem that is most similar to the last gem you picked. Also, choose the gem that that has a medium sized line and the one with the most vertical lines."
31,GEMS207,"The thinner the stripes, the more valuable the gem. Not sure if the direction of the stripes is important, I was thinking the more horizontal the more valuable."
32,GEMS208,I think the gems tilted at 10 degrees are most valuable. I also think that the gems with the biggest lines out of the 5 on the screen are the least valuable. Do not click the same gem more than 3 times in a row.
33,GEMS209,i thought that if they looked similiar it made them more valuable but then my points started decreasing so i am really not sure what makes some gems more valuable than others
34,GEMS210,the lines form about 45 degree with the horizontal line. Should not be too dense. Black and white lines should be about the same width.
35,GEMS211,The gems are more vauluable when they are bolder and have more lines.They have more focued in their appearance then the one before it meaning it is usually more valuable then the last one you saw.
36,GEMS212,"I think that if one of the other gems, in the relation to one's prvious pick, has more lines, then it is most likely more valuable. Also, if the colors of the new jem coincide with the last stripe color on the old jem, it will also be worth more."
37,GEMS213,"As you go farther on in the game, the gems start to contain more lines, so choose a gem that has more lines than the first one. They also begin to change angles as the lines aren't level. When you're picking gems, alternate the angles of the lines with each new gem."
38,GEMS214,"What I think makes some gems more valuable is by how many lines there are. The more lines there are, the more valuable it is but then it changes because the gems with less lines is more valuable then the one with more lines."
39,GEMS215,I found that I got the most points when I selected a gem with each of its lines entirely showing. I also got zero points for an 8 stiped Gem...but I don't think that is much to work off of. Also I feel like when the lines of the gems are more blurry they are worth less.
40,GEMS216,"In order to be successful in this experiement you need to not get frusterated and allow yourself to experiment new options even if points may be lost. I looked for gems that were similar to one another, but I don't think I uncovered the pattern."
41,GEMS217,I really can't tell what is happening all I just tried to pick the mopst similar gem when I got points and most different gem when I got negative points
42,GEMS218,"While looking for gems, there appears to be a trend between the number of lines and the tilt of the lines. You should prioritize the number of lines up until a point. However, when it comes to tilt, you want to prioritize the rotation until they become parallel horizontally. Once you are at parallel, the number of lines must be fine tuned in order to find the gem of the most value."
43,GEMS219,I think that the more titled they were from the starting postion and the more lines through the gem correlated to the more valuable gem
44,GEMS220,"select gems that have less number of lines and and have a slope that increases going left to right. If the extremes of the pattern ends in white, or white with slight hint of black, they may be worth value"
45,GEMS221,"I might just be stupid but I couldn't really find a set pattern. I thought it was the smaller lines meant they were more valuable but then they would have negative numbers some times, same with how crisp the lines were, or the angle they were tilted at."
46,GEMS222,"I'm not super positive but I think what makes certain gems more valuable than others is determined by where they land on the in the sequence. The pattern shifts every other gem and shifts one step to the right each time. Overall, I think that sequencing and left to right movement has something to do with how gems are arranged."
47,GEMS223,"Consistency... how clear or defined they are, usually the clearer they were, the more value they had. The number of bands also made a difference in the value of the gem. Usually the number of bands meant a higher value"
48,GEMS224,the gems that are more valuable have more diagonal lines and don't have too many lines in the gem but also don't have too few lines so they are right in the middle.
49,GEMS225,Try the ones with thin lines and standing more vertical. Do not pick the same gem as you did the previous time. Try and find a pattern to the game.
50,GEMS226,"find the gem that is wider for each line. the lines for each valuable gems all go in the same directon. the line tend to be more and more condense as value increase, and the value of the next gem increase as the lines of the last gem go up a little bit."
51,GEMS227,"I do not kno how the points operate, but it appears that if you click ones with thicker lines, then the next set will also have thicker lines and vice versa with smaller lines."
52,GEMS228,the amout of lines and how think the lines are and which way the are facing for example gems with more lines are more valuable
53,GEMS229,"Gem stones are more valuable when the stripes are closest to horizontal, or closer to horizontal than the last chosen gem."
54,GEMS230,I think the ending has of the gems have a lot to do with the outcome of the score. I would also look at the boldness and the thickness of each line in comparison to the previous gem that you have chose.
55,GEMS231,"Stay consistent with one, two, or three gems rather than randomly clicking on all of them. The gains usually outweight the losses. The value of the gems is based on the look of the lines in comparison to the previously chosen gem."
56,GEMS232,"The gems with more lines on them seem to be more valuable. When a gem is slightly tilted to the left, gems with more tilt in that direction seem to be more valuable as well."
57,GEMS233,"I thought this exercise was pretty hard. I still am unsure if I really know what makes some of the gems more valuable than others. Towards the end it seemed like the slanting of the lines had something to do with how valuable the gems were, but I was still unsure if that was really the formula."
58,GEMS234,"I thought that if the gem had thinner lines it was more valuable, and depending on the tilt of the lines and if it was more slanted than horizontal it was worth more as well."
59,GEMS235,"Try and pick gems similar to those that earn you points instead of taking away points. The less blurry the gem is, the better. as well as the thiner the black and white lines are the more points you will get."
60,GEMS236,"The gems that have the higher point total are the ones in which the white lines are more clear, and seem to get thicker as you move to the outside of the gem. If the white lines appear to be extremley blurry, they will have a lower point total."
61,GEMS237,"Generally, more stripes  more valuable gem. the 100 bitrock Gems I encountered were all rotated so the stripes where completely horizontal."
62,GEMS238,The gems that are most valuable are the ones with the most stripes and are slanted the most. Pay attention to the tops of the gems.
63,GEMS239,"I honestly am having a difficult time, but i thought it was the amount of lines and then i thought it was how tilted the gems were. then i thought it was position on the screen because third from left gem kept adding to my score but then i was proven wrong."
64,GEMS240,I feel like choosing a gem that was similar looking to the one selected before usually got a Decent result
65,GEMS241,"I believe that the more precious gems are on the left side. I believe the left most gem has a slight variablity. It ranges from plus 3 to negative 3, and The ones closer to the middle have greater ranges. The ones on the furthest to the left have the greatest ranges."
66,GEMS242,"I thried to focus on how thick the lines within the gems were.  I tneded to choose those with thinner lines over thicker lines and them based my next decision on what my last choice was.  If my last choice rewarded me with higher points, I tried to pick gems similar to that particular one."
67,GEMS243,The more valuable ones are darker and have more stripes and are rotated differenly than the ones picked before.
68,GEMS244,"The most valuable gems have lots of lines, and the lines are nearly horizontal. The lines should not be tilted."
69,GEMS245,"Gems that are have a steeper slope going from the bottom left to the top allow you to attain more points. As the stripes get closer to the horizontal, this same pattern continues. It also seems that more stripes, as well as more white are also more valueable than the previous gem you selected."
70,GEMS246,"I did not notice a trend with the appearance of the gems and their value. But, I did notice that when I clicked on gems from the middle and moved to the gems on the outside they tended to be positive values or zero values. This could just be a coincidence though."
71,GEMS247,I believe that the gems alternate from left to right and you have to select a certain gem based on the thickness of the lines located within it. I feel like if you had a thick one it would be the thinner one and than if you had a thin on it would become a thicker one.
72,GEMS248,"The gems went up in value when the lines became more horizontal.  Also, the amount of lines matters. More lines is good, but don't let the lines get too small where the top and bottom of the gem are no longer black otherwise the gems go down in value. Also, more defined lines on the gems usuallly make them more valuable."
73,GEMS249,"Look for more diagonal lines that have a medium thickness. This is in oppose to other gems you may see that are also consisting of diagonal lines, but either have very thick lines, or long and narrow lines."
74,GEMS250,"Always pick the gem with the most lines, and always pick a gem with the lines at a different angle. The gems with the more vertical lines seem to be worth more than others."
75,GEMS251,"the gems with the thinner lines are more desirable. try to pick gems with lines going in the same direction, and pick gems going slightly left or right to figure out which direction they want you to go. the gems where it seemed like the white lines were more prominent seemed more valuable."
76,GEMS252,"if the black lines are thicker in the circle that means the gem is more valuble. also, if the lines are thinner and there are less of them that makes the gemes more valuble."
77,GEMS254,"when the line is in low density, the picture that has more dense lines are more valuable, but when the density reach a max valus, it will not increase. also, when the line is nearly vertical , the picture with more horizontal lines is more valuable, but when the lines are nearly horizontal, the picture with more vertical lines is more valuable."
78,GEMS255,"I think this game is totally radom. But you can try to choose the one has thinker same color at the top compared to the one you choose before. I use it to get some points but it does not work later. Anyway, it is no bette than choose it randomly."
79,GEMS256,Some gems are more valuable depending on how many black lines are found in them and depending on what angle they are oriented in. Stick the more valuable gems are in between a lot of black lines and a small amount of black lines. They are usually angled slightly to the right.
80,GEMS257,Try to find a similar gem to the one you chose before. Look for clarity and line numbers. Try not too think to hard and go with your first instinct.
