What I found what that if you selected a gem for it's unique characteristics, for example having more lines or finer detail, then the next set of gems would all display those traits. In other words, the new set of gems looks a lot more like the gem you choose than the previous set of gems. So, pay attention to every detail before choosing the next gem, and then pick the more valuable gem and note the differences. I found success in paying attention to whether it looked like it was black lines on a white background or white lines on a black background, and got points by selecting the gem that had a, more bars, and b, looked like white bars on a black background.
