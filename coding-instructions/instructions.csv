GEMS101,"Try to pick the correct color endings at the edge of the circle horizontally. So, if the ending is black on the edges, then pick black edges for the next two rounds. The lines should be clear as well, instead of being blurry.If it is white ending on the edge do the same. More lines doesn't mean more valuable. Instructions may vary. This is a basic hypothesis that can be falsiable."
GEMS102,"It appears that in Quarry 1, you should never click on the same gem 2 times in a row. This leads to negative points. Also, avoid clicking adjacent gems, which also seems to lead to negative points. For Quarry 2, it seems like clicking on gems that are one over from each other, skipping the adjacent, leads to positive points."
GEMS103,"the direction and the number of strips seem to matter a lot. sometimes just a little off the best angle, if there is one, you will be getting a really bad gem"
GEMS104,All of the gems are random... Collect a bunch and I suppose you'll get the most points beacuse theyre mostly positive... Sorry I'm not a helpful pal
GEMS105,Try finding the gem that has the most stripes and is slanted about 45 degrees.Although this was not always the case. I would sometimes just guess randomly because a lot of the time they all looked the same to me.
GEMS106,"The lower left and upper right seem to add a lot of points. Also,  never the thinnest stripes or the thickest stripes have been successful."
GEMS107,I think that what makes a valuable gem is that the bars are clear and evenly spced out between eachother. Most of the time the gems are lined by white and have thick consice bars.
GEMS108,"choose the gem with the lines that are different than the majority of them. if that doesnt work, then you are looking at the wrong ones. they change everytime. it could be that the lines are thicker or that they are thinner but it is different everytime"
GEMS109,I never really figured out what makes some gems more valuable than others. Something that sort of helped me was not chosing in a pattern and also not chosing the one you think you should if that makes sense.
GEMS110,"Typically,I chose the gem whose lines appeared to be closest pointing to a 45 degree angle. I also chose the gems with thinner or more lines. Sometimes I found this method very helful, other times not at all."
GEMS111,"I thought that more lines meant more valuable I also found there was a pattern where I should select a gem with more lines and more rotated clockwise than the gem I had selected previously, however, this theory was not always correct and frustrated me."
GEMS112,"The more similar a gem looks to the one chosen before, the more likely it is to be more valuable. Gems with thicker stripes and gems with too thin of stripes seemed to be less valuable. Gems also seemed more valuable with not too many, but also not too little stripes."
GEMS113,"Even though I don't think it necessarily worked, I tried to choose the gem that looked like it 'did not fit' or the one that looked the most different. However, I looked for other patterns and it seemed to be random."
GEMS114,"the density of lines on the gems may be related to the value.More lines may indicate more value. Besides, the light lines may imply more value than bold lines according to my attempt. There may also exists relationship between the value of the gems and the gardient level of lines on the gems, but I do not figure it out clearly."
GEMS115,"I believe that the gems with the most shine to them are the most valuable.  you can tell based off of how much black to white there is.  with more lines to it, there will be more value."
GEMS116,"I do not think there is much of a difference in the gems. I compared the darkness of the black, the thickness of the lines, the angles in which the lines were going, the shifts of movement in the lines where in such as if the left end starts with a black or white striped line. Nothing helps, so good luck trying to score the most points."
GEMS117,The gems that have white borders on the right and left sides of the circle are more likely to be a postive value than circles that have black borders.
GEMS118,"It seemed that at the start the gems with lines that were more horizontal than verticle were more valuable. Also the gems with more lines seemed to be more valuable. However, it also seemed that as I selected they same style of gems mulitple times in a row, they would lose their value and sometimes even become negative so I recommend switching styles of gems if this happens."
GEMS119,Gems that are more valuable have a greater frequency of white and black lines and those lines are thinner than the lines on less valuable gems.A gem also increases in value the closer its lines get to being about 15 degrees counterclockwise of horizontal.
GEMS120,"Gems are more valuable as the lines become more abundant and 'zoomed out' in the circle. Also, the circle of lines should be rotating clockwise each time to be more valuable."
GEMS121,"The thinner the lines on the gem are, the more valuable it is. Also, the more horizontal those lines are, the more valuable it is."
GEMS122,The value of gems depends on the orientation of the lines on the gems. You want it to be as close to 180 degrees or horizontal as possible
GEMS123,"Pick gems that look similar to the one you previously picked, but less blurry along the stripes. The gem should be slanted the same way as the one you previously picked."
GEMS124,"The gems that are the most valuable I believe to be the ones with the most lines at the greatest angle. These are also the most visually clear, and less blurry."
GEMS125,"The more stripes are on the gem, the more valuable it is. The more it is tilted clockwise, the more it is valuable. Your score is not affected when you choose the same gem."
GEMS126,"the more similarity to the previously chosen one contributes to a higher value. also, the strips should not be too thick or too thin when you first choose it or when you need to choose between similar ones."
GEMS127,I thought that what was most important was the amount of line visible in the circle and how fuzzy it was.
GEMS128,"The more lines there are on the gem, the more points one will score especially towards the beginning. However it seems later towards the game, the number of lines didn't seem to matter as much. Later towards the game, the angle at which the lines appeared on the gem seemed to matter as well."
GEMS129,"Be very observant to how many lines and amount of black space there are between the white lines. Generally, the gems with less space, and more white bars ar more valuable. Also, the gems that have rotation of bars closer to facing horizontal, specifically anglig west to east will be more valuable."
GEMS130,"The person before me mentioned that they tested the gems for bar width, number of bars, thickness, angle of the bars, etc. As a result, I trusted their advice and resisted the urge to test the gems for the most basic factors. What I found what that if you selected a gem for it's unique characteristics, for example having more lines or finer detail, then the next set of gems would all display those traits. In other words, the new set of gems looks a lot more like the gem you choose than the previous set of gems. So, pay attention to every detail before choosing the next gem, and then pick the more valuable gem and note the differences. I found success in paying attention to whether it looked like it was black lines on a white background or white lines on a black background, and got points by selecting the gem that had a, more bars, and b, looked like white bars on a black background. Don't let this narrow your mind, though, but try it and see if it works. Otherwise, go to the strategy I mentioned above"
GEMS131,"Turn the lines on the gem clockwise after you choose a gem. Generally, more lines and further clockwise yields higher and positive values. Choose similar a gem that is similar to the last one you picked at around 90 to 95 points. The gem will have many lines on it and be approximately horizontal."
GEMS132,I think the one has more part of white is more valuable.You probably can't choose the same three times.
GEMS133,"stared at them, comparing the thickness of lines and choose the less thicker one. and the space between them, as well as the angle of these line."
GEMS134,"As you continue throughout the collection process, choosing the gems with more and more lines givs you points as well as the gems turning clockwise. He gems will increase in the number of lines and once the gems have turned half way going clockwise, they turn counterclockwise back to their original position, I believe."
GEMS135,pay attention to if the lines are horizontal or not and if there is more dark if there is more dark dont select it. Later try to minimize losses by picking the gems closest to the one below because it is hard to gain at that point
GEMS136,"The clearer the image and the more horizontal the lines are on it, the better the gem. Be sure to know that placement does not matter."
GEMS137,"I think gems with a higher number of lines are more valuable than gems with lower numbers. I'm not completely sure what the direction of the lines has to do with the value, but I think choosing ones close to the previously selected valuable gem will end up being the next most valuable gem."
GEMS138,"I found that picking gems most similar to the gem presented got me the most points. However, when I picked the gem that was identical to the gem presented, a majority of the time I got zero points. I also tried to see if the number of lines and thickness of lines make the gems more valuable. I found that more lines usually means the gem is more valuable. I did not find anything important regarding the thickness of the lines."
GEMS141,I have no idea. Maybe the slant of the gem or pattern of colors. If a black strip is at the edge of the circle or a white strip.
GEMS142,I believe the ones that are the most valuable are the ones that have the sharpest edges between the white and black strips as well as at a larger angle compared with the rest.
GEMS143,"There seems to be a number of lines which yields points more often than not. I think this was around 8.  I did notice that the first gem is worth 22 points, and that one only has five lines. I couldn't find a pattern with orientation or color. I had thought at first that the farther clockwise they go, the more worth they would have, but this proved false."
GEMS144,"the gems that have more white lines and less black space are more valuable than those that don't. usually, the ones in the middle are worth more points than those on the outside, however, this is questionable at times."
GEMS145,"I think what makes more gems valuable than others is the placement of the gems and where they are located. I noticed that when clicking on the same gem in the same place multiple times, the values changed, so you have to explore other gems and move around."
GEMS146,"There really wasn't anything that stood out to me. To be honest, a lot of times I didn't even notice a difference."
GEMS147,"I think that the gems with the more black, i.e. black background with white stripes were more valuable. Also, gems with strips facing the one pm position."
