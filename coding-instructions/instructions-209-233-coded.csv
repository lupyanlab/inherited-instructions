pierce,3,2,Orientation,GEMS210,the lines form about 45 degree with the horizontal line. Should not be too dense. Black and white lines should be about the same width.

pierce,0,3,Orientation,GEMS211,The gems are more vauluable when they are bolder and have more lines.They have more focued in their appearance then the one before it meaning it is usually more valuable then the last one you saw.

pierce,0,4,Orientation,GEMS212,"I think that if one of the other gems, in the relation to one's prvious pick, has more lines, then it is most likely more valuable. Also, if the colors of the new jem coincide with the last stripe color on the old jem, it will also be worth more."

pierce,1,5,Orientation,GEMS213,"As you go farther on in the game, the gems start to contain more lines, so choose a gem that has more lines than the first one. They also begin to change angles as the lines aren't level. When you're picking gems, alternate the angles of the lines with each new gem."

pierce,0,7,Orientation,GEMS215,I found that I got the most points when I selected a gem with each of its lines entirely showing. I also got zero points for an 8 stiped Gem...but I don't think that is much to work off of. Also I feel like when the lines of the gems are more blurry they are worth less.

pierce,3,10,Orientation,GEMS218,"While looking for gems, there appears to be a trend between the number of lines and the tilt of the lines. You should prioritize the number of lines up until a point. However, when it comes to tilt, you want to prioritize the rotation until they become parallel horizontally. Once you are at parallel, the number of lines must be fine tuned in order to find the gem of the most value."

pierce,1,13,Orientation,GEMS221,"I might just be stupid but I couldn't really find a set pattern. I thought it was the smaller lines meant they were more valuable but then they would have negative numbers some times, same with how crisp the lines were, or the angle they were tilted at."

pierce,0,14,Orientation,GEMS222,"I'm not super positive but I think what makes certain gems more valuable than others is determined by where they land on the in the sequence. The pattern shifts every other gem and shifts one step to the right each time. Overall, I think that sequencing and left to right movement has something to do with how gems are arranged."

pierce,0,15,Orientation,GEMS223,"Consistency... how clear or defined they are, usually the clearer they were, the more value they had. The number of bands also made a difference in the value of the gem. Usually the number of bands meant a higher value"
