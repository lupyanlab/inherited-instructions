1,GEMS209,i thought that if they looked similiar it made them more valuable but then my points started decreasing so i am really not sure what makes some gems more valuable than others
2,GEMS210,the lines form about 45 degree with the horizontal line. Should not be too dense. Black and white lines should be about the same width.
3,GEMS211,The gems are more vauluable when they are bolder and have more lines.They have more focued in their appearance then the one before it meaning it is usually more valuable then the last one you saw.
4,GEMS212,"I think that if one of the other gems, in the relation to one's prvious pick, has more lines, then it is most likely more valuable. Also, if the colors of the new jem coincide with the last stripe color on the old jem, it will also be worth more."
5,GEMS213,"As you go farther on in the game, the gems start to contain more lines, so choose a gem that has more lines than the first one. They also begin to change angles as the lines aren't level. When you're picking gems, alternate the angles of the lines with each new gem."
6,GEMS214,"What I think makes some gems more valuable is by how many lines there are. The more lines there are, the more valuable it is but then it changes because the gems with less lines is more valuable then the one with more lines."
7,GEMS215,I found that I got the most points when I selected a gem with each of its lines entirely showing. I also got zero points for an 8 stiped Gem...but I don't think that is much to work off of. Also I feel like when the lines of the gems are more blurry they are worth less.
8,GEMS216,"In order to be successful in this experiement you need to not get frusterated and allow yourself to experiment new options even if points may be lost. I looked for gems that were similar to one another, but I don't think I uncovered the pattern."
9,GEMS217,I really can't tell what is happening all I just tried to pick the mopst similar gem when I got points and most different gem when I got negative points
10,GEMS218,"While looking for gems, there appears to be a trend between the number of lines and the tilt of the lines. You should prioritize the number of lines up until a point. However, when it comes to tilt, you want to prioritize the rotation until they become parallel horizontally. Once you are at parallel, the number of lines must be fine tuned in order to find the gem of the most value."
11,GEMS219,I think that the more titled they were from the starting postion and the more lines through the gem correlated to the more valuable gem
12,GEMS220,"select gems that have less number of lines and and have a slope that increases going left to right. If the extremes of the pattern ends in white, or white with slight hint of black, they may be worth value"
13,GEMS221,"I might just be stupid but I couldn't really find a set pattern. I thought it was the smaller lines meant they were more valuable but then they would have negative numbers some times, same with how crisp the lines were, or the angle they were tilted at."
14,GEMS222,"I'm not super positive but I think what makes certain gems more valuable than others is determined by where they land on the in the sequence. The pattern shifts every other gem and shifts one step to the right each time. Overall, I think that sequencing and left to right movement has something to do with how gems are arranged."
15,GEMS223,"Consistency... how clear or defined they are, usually the clearer they were, the more value they had. The number of bands also made a difference in the value of the gem. Usually the number of bands meant a higher value"
16,GEMS224,the gems that are more valuable have more diagonal lines and don't have too many lines in the gem but also don't have too few lines so they are right in the middle.
17,GEMS225,Try the ones with thin lines and standing more vertical. Do not pick the same gem as you did the previous time. Try and find a pattern to the game.
18,GEMS226,"find the gem that is wider for each line. the lines for each valuable gems all go in the same directon. the line tend to be more and more condense as value increase, and the value of the next gem increase as the lines of the last gem go up a little bit."
19,GEMS227,"I do not kno how the points operate, but it appears that if you click ones with thicker lines, then the next set will also have thicker lines and vice versa with smaller lines."
20,GEMS228,the amout of lines and how think the lines are and which way the are facing for example gems with more lines are more valuable
21,GEMS229,"Gem stones are more valuable when the stripes are closest to horizontal, or closer to horizontal than the last chosen gem."
22,GEMS230,I think the ending has of the gems have a lot to do with the outcome of the score. I would also look at the boldness and the thickness of each line in comparison to the previous gem that you have chose.
23,GEMS231,"Stay consistent with one, two, or three gems rather than randomly clicking on all of them. The gains usually outweight the losses. The value of the gems is based on the look of the lines in comparison to the previously chosen gem."
24,GEMS232,"The gems with more lines on them seem to be more valuable. When a gem is slightly tilted to the left, gems with more tilt in that direction seem to be more valuable as well."
25,GEMS233,"I thought this exercise was pretty hard. I still am unsure if I really know what makes some of the gems more valuable than others. Towards the end it seemed like the slanting of the lines had something to do with how valuable the gems were, but I was still unsure if that was really the formula."
